# PV056_project

This project was done in collaboration with Filip Chládek and Martin Beňa. We were comparing [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/rf.html) with decision tree and random forest as base-learner (using parameter num_parallel_tree) on datasets with different problems. The report can be found in PV056_report.pdf. xgboost with decision tree base-learner perfomed better.
