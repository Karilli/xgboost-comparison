# Description

This project was done in collaboration with Filip Chládek and Bc. Martin Beňa as part of our assignment during PV056 class at Masaryk University. We were comparing [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/rf.html) with decision tree and random forest as base-learner (using parameter num_parallel_tree) on datasets with different problems. The report can be found in PV056_report.pdf. xgboost with decision tree base-learner perfomed better. The project was done under supervision of Bc. Terézia Mikulová and doc. RNDr. Lubomír Popelínský, Ph.D.
